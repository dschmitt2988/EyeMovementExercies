# Eye Movement Exercise

Project Title: Eye Movement Exercise 

Description: A web page created with two eyes that follow the user’s mouse movement.  The exercise was geared to require integrating skills learned in JavaScript and CSS to allow the eyes to appear and follow the dynamic movements of the user’s mouse.  The exercise also was an introduction to how mouse events are a popular way to link the DOM elements to events.  Starter code was given and the task was to add a second eye and have the eye follow the mouse movements as well.

How to Run: To run the Eye Movement Exercise on your machine, download the following files to the same local folder: index.html, eyes.js, styles.css.  Next, open the index.html with your browser.  Move the mouse across the screen to watch how the eyes follow the mouse movement. 

Roadmap of Future Improvements: I would like to continue to update the eyes to do different events on different mouse actions such as blinking when the user clicks the mouse.  Also, using techniques from this exercise I would like to create more advanced “games” for users to play with the mouse.
